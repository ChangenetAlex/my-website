 abstract = {Aim: Tree mortality is increasing worldwide, leading to changes in forest composition and altering global biodiversity. Yet, due to the multi-faceted stochastic nature of tree mortality, large-scale spatial patterns of mortality across species ranges and their underlying drivers remain difficult to understand. Our main goal is to describe the geographical patterns and drivers of the occurrence and intensity of tree mortality in Europe. We hypothesize that the occurrence of mortality represents background mortality and is higher in the margin than the core populations, whereas the intensity of mortality could have a more even distribution according to the spatial and temporal stochasticity of die-off events.},
