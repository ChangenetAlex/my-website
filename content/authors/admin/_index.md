I am interested in forest ecology and evolution, especially in questions related to the populations and species responses to climate change. To tackle these questions I am keen to use tools involving modelling, statistics and simulations. 

I am currently finsihing my Ph.D in Biogeco, INRAE Bordeaux. Based on the national forest inventories of 6 countries, I develop species-specific mortality and recruitment models on twenty ecologically and economically important tree species in European forests. I am investigating how drought, competition and stand composition interact and affect recruitment and mortality along the latitudinal gradient and more specifically in climatically marginal parts of the range.
