abstract: 'Aim: Tree mortality is increasing worldwide, leading to changes in forest composition and altering
global biodiversity. Yet, due to the multi-faceted stochastic nature of tree mortality, large-scale spatial patterns of mortality across species ranges and their underlying drivers remain difficult to understand.
Our main goal is to describe the geographical patterns and drivers of the occurrence and intensity of tree mortality in Europe. We hypothesize that the occurrence of mortality represents background mortality and is higher in the margin than the core populations, whereas the intensity of mortality could have a more even distribution according to the spatial and temporal stochasticity of die-off
events.

Location: Europe (Spain, France, Germany, Belgium, Sweden and Finland)
Time period: 1981 to 2014.
Major taxa studied: More than 1.5 million trees belonging to 20 major forest tree species
Methods: We develop hurdle models to tease apart the occurrence and intensity of tree mortality in National Forest Inventory plots at range-wide scale. The occurrence of mortality indicates that at least one tree has died in the plot and the intensity of mortality refers to the number of trees dead per plot.

Results: The highest mortality occurrence was found in peripheral regions and the climatic trailing edge linked with drought, whereas the intensity of mortality was driven by competition, drought and high temperatures and was uniformly scattered across species ranges.'
